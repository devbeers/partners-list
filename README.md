Partners / Sponsors List
=============

The purpose of this list is to **help developer-focused event organizers**, anywhere in the world, to find **contact information** for companies that are interested in helping partner, or sponsor events. 

The time each company takes to reply may vary, and it **does not mean** that sending your requests to them will **guarantee partnerships/sponsorships**.

Please try to include some basic information such as:

- Event Name
- Date
- Location (Venue, City, Country)
- Approximate number of attendees expected
- Partner / Sponsorship Requirements

Let's throw some kick-ass events!
